## [1.5.3] - 2024-09-04

### Added

- [frontend]: Added mattermdnsinterface, matteripv4address and matteripv6address to the matter settings. If no parameters are added, Matterbridge will use the settings from the frontend that are saved. The default is all interfaces. If you are facing issues with pairing, I suggest to try first to put the interfaceName (e.g eth0, WiFi) in the MdnsInterface field. When nothing is selected, NodeJs will choose the interface but sometimes the choice is not correct at all.

## [1.3.2] - 2024-06-22

New plugin

[shelly](https://github.com/Luligu/matterbridge-shelly)

Matterbridge shelly allows you to expose Shelly Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3 devices to Matter.

Features:

- Shellies are automatically discovered using mDNS.
- Discovered shellies are stored in local storage for quick loading on startup.
- In this first release, the components exposed are lights (with brightness), switches, rollers and power meters (with EveHistory electrical measurements).
- Shellies are controlled locally, eliminating the need for cloud or MQTT (which can be disabled).
- Shelly Gen 1 devices are controlled using the CoIoT protocol (see the note below).
- Shelly Gen 2 and Gen 3 devices are controlled using WebSocket.
- The Matter device takes the name configured in the Shelly device's web page.
- A 10-minute timer checks if the device has reported in that time.

### Added

  CarbonMonoxideConcentrationMeasurement,
  CarbonDioxideConcentrationMeasurement,
