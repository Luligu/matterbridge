# matterbridge

Matterbridge is a Matter.js plugin manager. 

It allows you to have all your Matter devices up and running in a couple of minutes without
having to deal with the pairing process of each single device. 

The developer just focuses on the device development.

You just pair Matterbridge once, and it will load all your registered plugins.

This project aims to allow the porting of homebridge plugins to matterbridge plugins without recoding everything.

It creates a MatterBridge device to pair in any ecosystem like Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, or 
any other ecosystem supporting matter.

The project is build on https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js. 

A special thank to Apollon77 for is incredible work.
