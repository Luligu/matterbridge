# matterbridge
Matterbridge is a Matter.js plugin manager. 
It allows to have all your Matter devices up and running in couple of minutes without
having to deal with the pairing process of each single device. 
The developer just focus on the device development.
You just pair Matterbridge once and it will load all your registered plugins.
This project aims to allow the porting from homebridge plugins to matterbridge pulgins without recoding everything.
It creates a MatterBridge device to pair in any ecosystems like Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa or 
any other ecosystem supporting matter.
The project uses https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js from https://github.com/project-chip.
